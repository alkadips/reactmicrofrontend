I need brushup 
1) module fedration plugin/react/redux
2) module fedration container
3) microfrontends with iframe/react redux
4) flex layout

-------------------
The container tries to provide shared modules,
modulefedrationPlugin:


Module federation allows a JavaScript application to dynamically load code from another
 application — in the process, sharing dependencies, 
 if an application consuming a federated module does not have a dependency needed by the federated 
 code — Webpack will download the missing dependency from that federated build origin.
